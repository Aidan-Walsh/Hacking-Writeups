- This challenge is very simply just password cracking a password-protected zip.
- This requires a tool to do so, I used John-The-Ripper PK2ZIP to first obtain a hash of the required password and then the basic cracker to reverse the hash using John-The-Ripper's basic passwordlist
- The following commands below were used:
- ```./zip2john ../../p1.zip > p1hash```
- ```./john --wordlist=password.lst p1hash```
- This gave us the password "tomatoes"
- We could then unzip the file, and open the file containing the flag
